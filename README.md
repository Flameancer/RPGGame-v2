# RPGGame-v2
This is a revision of a game I made for a final project in the class *Intro to Computer Science* At Carleton College.
The basic goal of the game is to progress through the story
and reach the final boss. Unfortunately as of right now the story is linear in nature so the wrong choice can lead in death.
Hope you will enjoy the remake. More features will be included as I see fit.
